# Hi

Hi! I'm a full stack developer with 8 years of work experience. I specialize in developing high-performance, interactive applications.

I'm passionate about solving problems with clean code and elegant design. 

My goal is to create user-friendly applications that are both visually appealing and easy to use. I strive to stay up to date with the latest technologies in the React and React Native space.

If you're looking for a developer with an eye for detail and a passion for creating great user experiences, please reach out to me. I'd love to hear about your project!
